Predict machine failure using the predictive Maintenance Dataset

This project involves creating four models to predict machine failure for the predictive maintenance dataset taken from the UCI machine learning repository.
The following steps are followed in this project:
1.Data Description
2.Data visualization
3.Dataset cleaning
4.Feature Extraction
5.Model Development
6.Fine-tune model and feature set
7.Performance

To run the project, run the jupyter notebook final_code.ipynb file.
The dataset is taken from the UCI machine learning repository:
